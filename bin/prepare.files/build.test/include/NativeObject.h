 * a C++ object instance that is not directly usable from within Java, but needed to
 * do work inside of native Java methods.
 *
 * In order for this class to work properly, the corresponding Java class must also
 * implement the `NativeObject` interface provided in the JniHelpers jar.
 *
 * The NativeObject instance is stored internally in a `long` field within the Java
 * object, and must be manually deleted since it cannot be garbage collected. For
 * example usage, see the test cases distributed with JniHelpers.

  /**
   * @brief Persist this object as a reference in a Java object
   *
   * Sometimes you might need to create a C++ object with a long lifespan which may
   * be too expensive to keep copying between native and Java code. Or perhaps the
   * C++ object contains members which are not easily mapped to Java types and can't
   * be copied up to Java.
   *
   * In such cases, it makes more sense to create the C++ object on the heap and
   * pass a reference to it up to Java. In this manner, subsequent calls from Java
   * may return to native code and retrieve the native object instance directly.
   *
   * For this method to work, your Java class must declare a `long` field named
   * `PERSIST_FIELD_NAME` (which is defined to `nPtr`). If your class defines such
   * a field, then it will be used by ClassRegistry::newInstance to give you a
   * pointer to that instance instead of creating a new object.
   *
   * Note that this implies that you may only have one persisted native object in
   * memory at any given time. Also, you are responsible for disposing of it; the
   * preferred convention for this is to define a native method to call destroy().
   * This is perhaps a bit tedious, however that's one of the risks of mixing Java
   * and C++ lifecycles. Therefore, you should only use this if you absolutely
   * cannot copy object data to Java via the toJavaObject() method.
   *
   * Rather than make assumptions on how your application manages memory, calling
   * this method multiple times with different objects will leak them rather than
   * free them. To free the objects, you should call destroy() instead. You've been
   * warned!
   *
   * The restrictions of the hard-coded field name and limitation of one persisted
   * object may be removed in a future version of the library.
   *
   * @param env JNIEnv
   * @param javaThis Java object to set the field on (may not be NULL)
   * @return True if the object was persisted, false otherwise. If your class is
   *         incorrectly configured (ie, has no field named `nPtr`) then this
   *         method will return false rather than throwing.
